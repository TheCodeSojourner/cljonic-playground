## Session State

- last_session_id: 2026-08-28-clang-format-config-ai-token-density
- current_timestamp: 2026-08-28
- recover: 1
- session_complete: true

Task:
1. Reconfigure project formatting with a repo-root `.clang-format` file tuned for AI/parser token density and reformat the codebase.
2. Upgrade clang-format from 18 to 20 (Ubuntu 24.04 apt `clang-format-20`; symlink `/usr/bin/clang-format`).
3. Verify the reconfiguration end-to-end (`make format`, `make lint`, `make test`).
4. Pending: Phase B Step 2 (concept spec tests + no-heap probe), Phase B Step 3 (spec-to-code traceability snapshot reconciliation), Phase C (containers conform to count/is_empty/operators), Phase D (constrain free functions), Phase E (full-stack verification via make git).

Questions:
1. None unresolved.

Decisions:
1. `.clang-format` keys: `Standard: c++20`, `BreakBeforeBraces: Attach`, `BinPackArguments/Parameters: true`, `SortIncludes: CaseSensitive`, `RequiresClausePosition: OwnLine`, `IndentRequiresClause: true`, `ColumnLimit: 120`, `IndentWidth: 4`, `PointerAlignment: Left`, `SpaceBeforeParens: ControlStatements`, `AllowShort*: false`, `AlwaysBreakTemplateDeclarations: true` (Allman dropped).
2. `make format` and `make format-doc-samples` both invoke `clang-format` with no `-style` flag, so raw C/C++ and Doxygen example blocks share the root `.clang-format`.
3. clang-format 20.1.2 confirmed active after upgrade; `make format:ok`, `make lint:ok`, `make test` 54/54 pass.
4. All source/test files reformatted to the new style (large working-tree diff).

Next:
1. Commit the reformatting session: `.clang-format` + reformatted `src/`/`tests/` + mementum state/memory.
2. Phase B Step 2: add concept spec tests to `tests/cljonic-concepts-spec-tests.cpp` (cover 46 obligations from `specs/capabilities/concepts.allium`) + no-heap probe `tests/no_heap/cljonic-concepts-probes.cpp`.
3. Phase B Step 3: reconcile spec-to-code traceability snapshot (`make traceability-spec-to-code-update-snapshot`).
4. Phases C, D, E: containers conform, free functions constrained, full-stack verification.

## Historical Session Records

Task:
1. Align vocabulary.md and architecture.md with the C++ Core Guidelines concept-layer naming and rewrite architecture prose into lambda notation; all gybis-vocab-check, gypis-arch-check, and gypis-vocab-weed gates pass.
2. Establish 1:1 artifact granularity across specifications (`specs/primitives/*.allium`), headers (`src/cljonic-*.hpp` with dual compile-time/runtime Doxygen examples), tests (`tests/cljonic-*-spec-tests.cpp` with runtime volatile coverage), and dedicated probe files (`tests/no_heap/*.cpp`).
3. Ensure 100% line coverage visibility across all 22 source headers in `make coverage` and `coverage-src.info`.
4. Synthesize session learnings into `mementum/knowledge/header-addition-and-verification-lifecycle.md` and optimize `CMakeLists.txt` with `file(GLOB ... CONFIGURE_DEPENDS)`.

Questions:
1. None unresolved.

Decisions:
1. Group A and Group B primitive free functions are fully specified in Allium, implemented in dedicated headers, tested with Catch2, and verified across all strict quality gates.
2. Every header in `src/` provides runnable `main()` Doxygen examples with compile-time and runtime demonstrations across supported collection types.
3. Every header has a dedicated no-heap probe file under `tests/no_heap/` and appears in the coverage report at 100% line coverage.
4. `CMakeLists.txt` uses `file(GLOB ... CONFIGURE_DEPENDS)` for automatic test and probe source discovery.
5. All strict quality gates (`make upsert-gate-strict`, `make no-heap`, `make coverage-cli`) pass cleanly.

Next:
1. Proceed with the next increment of Module 3 free functions (`last`, `key`, `val`, `contains`, `nth`, comparisons `equal`/`not_equal`/etc.) or downstream Module 4 requirements as requested.

## Historical Session Records

Task:
1. Optimize `CMakeLists.txt` to replace manual source enumerations with `file(GLOB ... CONFIGURE_DEPENDS)` for both `CLJONIC_SPEC_TEST_SOURCES` and `CLJONIC_NO_HEAP_SOURCES`.
2. Validate that all quality gates (`make upsert-gate-strict`, `make no-heap`, `make coverage-cli`) pass cleanly with automatic source discovery.

Questions:
1. None unresolved.

Decisions:
1. Replaced static file lists in `CMakeLists.txt` with:
   - `file(GLOB CLJONIC_SPEC_TEST_SOURCES CONFIGURE_DEPENDS "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/cljonic-*-spec-tests.cpp")`
   - `file(GLOB CLJONIC_NO_HEAP_SOURCES CONFIGURE_DEPENDS "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/no_heap/*.cpp")`
2. `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS` guarantees CMake automatically detects added, deleted, or renamed test/probe files without requiring manual `CMakeLists.txt` editing.
3. Verified all strict quality gates pass with 100% coverage and zero heap allocation.

Next:
1. Ready for next increment.

## Historical Session Records

Task:
1. Verify and reconcile test/code implementations against specifications, architecture, and requirements for Modules 1-3 using gybis-spec-weed.
2. Resolve test coverage gap in MapEntry negative-index guard and eliminate false positive in no-heap scanner for String documentation comment.
3. Validate complete repository state across all quality gates (format, lint, complexity, sanitizers, coverage, traceability, no-heap, docs).

Task:
1. Update architecture.md with Module 3 core collection types, storage strategies, and primitive free functions.
2. Verify architecture.md internal integrity and consistency with vocabulary.md and Module 3 requirements using gybis-arch-check and gybis-vocab-weed.

Questions:
1. None unresolved.

Decisions:
1. Module 3 defines concrete collection types (Vector, Map, Set, Queue, String), contiguous array-backed storage, linear scan lookup, swap-and-remove policies, and primitive free functions (conj, assoc, dissoc, disj, peek, pop, seq, can_conj, can_assoc).
2. architecture.md successfully updated and verified through gybis-arch-check with 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 divergences.
3. Quality gates (make upsert-gate-strict) pass with 100% line coverage, no-heap verification, linting, complexity, sanitizers, and traceability.

Next:
1. Proceed with downstream Module 3 specifications (specs/collections/*.allium) or test/code implementation for Map, Set, Queue, String, and primitive free functions.

## Historical Session Records

Task:
1. Update vocabulary.md with Module 3 core collection types, storage strategies, and primitive free functions.
2. Deduplicate collection entries (Map, Set, Queue, String) in vocabulary.md.
3. Validate vocabulary.md using gybis-vocab-check to ensure syntax, completeness, and semantic integrity pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

Questions:
1. None unresolved.

Decisions:
1. Module 3 defines concrete collection types (Vector, Map, Set, Queue, String), contiguous array-backed storage, linear scan lookup, swap-and-remove policies, and primitive free functions (conj, assoc, dissoc, disj, peek, pop, seq, can_conj, can_assoc).
2. All collection types are unified into single canonical entries in vocabulary.md.
3. vocabulary.md validation passes cleanly with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

Next:
1. Proceed with downstream Module 3 artifacts (specs or architecture refinement) as requested.
