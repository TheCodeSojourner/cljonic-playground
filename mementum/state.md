Task:
1. Verify and reconcile test/code implementations against specifications, architecture, and requirements for Modules 1-3 using gybis-spec-weed.
2. Resolve test coverage gap in MapEntry negative-index guard and eliminate false positive in no-heap scanner for String documentation comment.
3. Validate complete repository state across all quality gates (format, lint, complexity, sanitizers, coverage, traceability, no-heap, docs).

Questions:
1. None unresolved.

Decisions:
1. Added runtime test coverage with volatile-derived inputs for `MapEntry::valid_index` signed negative-index check to ensure GCC code coverage instrumentation records execution.
2. Reworded Doxygen comment in `cljonic-string.hpp` to prevent false positive matching on the `new ` token in the source no-heap scan.
3. Verified all 213 specification obligations across MapEntry, Map, Set, Queue, String, and Vector map directly to `TRACE_ID` test assertions.
4. All quality gates pass cleanly (format, lint, complexity, sanitizers, 100% line coverage, traceability, no-heap, and release-quality docs).

Next:
1. Proceed with Module 4 requirements and specifications or downstream features as requested.

## Historical Session Records

Task:
1. Update architecture.md with Module 3 core collection types, storage strategies, and primitive free functions.
2. Verify architecture.md internal integrity and consistency with vocabulary.md and Module 3 requirements using gybis-arch-check and gybis-vocab-weed.

Questions:
1. None unresolved.

Decisions:
1. Module 3 defines concrete collection types (Vector, Map, Set, Queue, String), contiguous array-backed storage, linear scan lookup, swap-and-remove policies, and primitive free functions (conj, assoc, dissoc, disj, peek, pop, seq, can_conj, can_assoc).
2. architecture.md successfully updated and verified through gybis-arch-check with 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 divergences.
3. Quality gates (make upsert-gate-strict) pass with 100% line coverage, no-heap verification, linting, complexity, sanitizers, and traceability.

Next:
1. Proceed with downstream Module 3 specifications (specs/collections/*.allium) or test/code implementation for Map, Set, Queue, String, and primitive free functions.

## Historical Session Records

Task:
1. Update vocabulary.md with Module 3 core collection types, storage strategies, and primitive free functions.
2. Deduplicate collection entries (Map, Set, Queue, String) in vocabulary.md.
3. Validate vocabulary.md using gybis-vocab-check to ensure syntax, completeness, and semantic integrity pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

Questions:
1. None unresolved.

Decisions:
1. Module 3 defines concrete collection types (Vector, Map, Set, Queue, String), contiguous array-backed storage, linear scan lookup, swap-and-remove policies, and primitive free functions (conj, assoc, dissoc, disj, peek, pop, seq, can_conj, can_assoc).
2. All collection types are unified into single canonical entries in vocabulary.md.
3. vocabulary.md validation passes cleanly with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

Next:
1. Proceed with downstream Module 3 artifacts (specs or architecture refinement) as requested.
